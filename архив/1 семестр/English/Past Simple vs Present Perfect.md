## Difference between Past Simple and Present Perfect

### Past Simple
**When:**
- The action happened **in the past** and is **finished**
- The time is **known, stated, or implied**
- Often used with: *yesterday, last week, in 2020, two days ago*

**Form:**
- Regular: `verb + -ed`
- Irregular: `go → went`, `see → saw`

**Examples:**
- I **watched** this movie yesterday.
- She **finished** the project last week.

### Present Perfect
**When:**
- The action happened **in the past**, but it is **connected to the present**
- The exact time is **not important or not mentioned**
- Often used with: *already, just, yet, ever, never, recently*

**Form:**
- `have / has + past participle`
- `do → done`, `see → seen`

**Examples:**
- I **have watched** this movie.
- She **has finished** the project.

### Key Difference
- **Past Simple** → focuses on **when** something happened  
- **Present Perfect** → focuses on the **result or experience**

**Compare:**
- I **lost** my keys yesterday. *(past event, finished)*
- I **have lost** my keys. *(result: I don’t have them now)*
