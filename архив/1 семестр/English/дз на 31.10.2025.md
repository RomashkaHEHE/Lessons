- **More crimes will be prevented** if CCTV cameras are installed all over the town.  
    _It is believed that criminals will be afraid to act when they know they are being watched._
    
- **Suspicious activities can be detected more easily** through the monitoring of social networks and phone calls.  
    _This system is expected to help the police react faster._
    
- **Citizens will be better protected** because police spot checks and cameras will help identify dangerous people.  
    _It is thought that safety in public places will be improved._
    
- **Stolen cars can be found more quickly** thanks to number plate recognition cameras.  
    _This technology is already being used successfully in other cities._
    
- **Teenagers behavior will be controlled more effectively** when their locations are registered on GPS systems.  
    _It is hoped that this measure will reduce vandalism and violence among young people._
